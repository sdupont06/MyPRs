# About

MyPRs is solo project I created my freshman year of college in order
to gain more experience with React and general app development. As a Teen III
USAPL lifter myself, a workout app was an obvious choice for this, and MyPRs
was designed with all of the features I'd like to see in an app like this.


MyPRs is still very much in development! It is not currently listed
on any app stores since I don't feel especially inclined to lose money on
this project, however it is fully functional and I would be more than happy
to release it publicly if the time felt right. I plan to add tons more features,
including my own in-app editable spreadsheet interface, tracking capabilities
for runners, perhaps a macro tracker, and more. Any suggestions for improvement
are highly appreciated. From an aspiring software engineer, thank you for checking
out MyPRs. Have a great lift!
