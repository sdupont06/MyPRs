# About

\tMyPRs is solo project I created my freshman year of college in order\n
to gain more experience with React and general app development. As a Teen III\n
USAPL lifter myself, a workout app was an obvious choice for this, and MyPRs\n
was designed with all of the features I'd like to see in an app like this.

\n\n

\tMyPRs is still very much in development! It is not currently listed \n
on any app stores since I don't feel especially inclined to lose money on\n
this project, however it is fully functional and I would be more than happy\n
to release it publicly if the time felt right. I plan to add tons more features,\n
including my own in-app editable spreadsheet interface, tracking capabilities\n
for runners, perhaps a macro tracker, and more. Any suggestions for improvement\n
are highly appreciated. From an aspiring software engineer, thank you for checking\n
out MyPRs. Have a great lift!
